### Establishing a German GmbH Subsidiary: Key Steps for Japanese Companies

The decision to establish a subsidiary in Germany represents a strategic expansion into one of Europe's most dynamic markets. For Japanese firms, the Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung (GmbH)—Germany's equivalent to a limited liability company—offers a robust structure with liability limited to invested capital and favorable tax treatment. As of 2025, the process remains streamlined yet requires meticulous preparation, particularly for cross-border setups involving notarization, apostilles, and capital deposits.

This post outlines the core steps for incorporating a GmbH, drawing on established legal practices. While it provides a high-level overview, individual circumstances—such as company purpose or shareholder structure—demand tailored advice. For personalized guidance, including document preparation and compliance checks, contact us for a unique solution to your project.

#### Initial Preparation: Confirming Essentials

Before formal proceedings, clarify foundational elements: the proposed company name (e.g., "XXX GmbH"), registered address (e.g., Berlin), and operational setup. A German address is mandatory for receiving court correspondence, even during incorporation. Options include a physical office, virtual office, or co-working space; in Berlin, providers like Space Shack are commonly utilized for their reliability and cost-efficiency.

Shareholders should confirm these details early to avoid delays. Japanese parent companies typically serve as the majority shareholder, ensuring control while leveraging the GmbH's flexibility.

#### Step 1: Drafting the Articles of Association

The foundational document, the Satzung (articles of association), must comply with the German Limited Liability Companies Act (GmbHG). It includes essential provisions: company purpose, fiscal year, and share capital.

- **Share Capital:** Minimum €25,000, fully paid in cash or assets. To optimize, allocate the base €25,000 as registered capital and additional funds as capital reserves, which bypass notarization.
- **Fiscal Year:** Defaults to the calendar year but can align with Japanese standards (April 1 to March 31) for consolidated reporting.
- **Company Purpose:** Detail intended activities, such as manufacturing, distribution, or technology services. Reference existing Japanese documents or describe planned German operations.

Once drafted, the articles are reviewed for efficiency and compliance. This step sets the GmbH's operational framework, influencing future governance.

#### Step 2: Notarization at the Notary Public

Notarization is the pivotal legal act, requiring declaration of formation before a German notary. The authorized representative of the Japanese parent—typically the president with sole signing authority—must sign the formation documents and resolution in person.

- **In-Person Attendance:** If traveling to Germany, the notary appointment can be accompanied by legal counsel for real-time explanations.
- **Power of Attorney (PoA):** For remote participation, grant a PoA to a German-based agent (e.g., a law firm). The PoA must be notarized by a Japanese notary, apostilled by Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and certified translated into German. Note: Only the principal (not an assistant) can execute this; Japan's "witness authentication" is not permissible in Germany.

Additionally, submit a "Certificate of Incumbency" (or equivalent, such as an abridged commercial register extract) proving the representative's authority. This too requires notarization, apostille, and translation.

All Japanese documents are forwarded to German counsel for processing, with costs quoted in advance. This ensures seamless integration into the notary protocol.

#### Step 3: Opening a Bank Account and Capital Contribution

Post-notarization, open a corporate bank account in the GmbH's name to deposit the share capital. Coordinate with a German bank in advance; upon notarization, the notary provides a digital certificate of formation for immediate submission.

- Transfer the €25,000 (plus reserves) from Japan.
- Within usually one week, the bank issues a deposit confirmation, submitted electronically to the notary.

This step verifies financial commitment and is prerequisite for registration. Select banks experienced in international transfers to minimize forex and timing issues.

#### Step 4: Appointing the Managing Director and Commercial Register Entry

Simultaneously or sequentially, appoint the GmbH's managing director (Geschäftsführer) via a declaration of acceptance. This document requires notarized signature—either in Germany during the formation appointment or remotely via PoA with apostille and translation.

Once complete, compile all documents for submission to the local commercial register (Handelsregister) via the notary. Processing takes 1–2 weeks for the invoice, followed by another week post-payment for final entry. Upon completion, the GmbH gains legal personality, a tax ID, and VAT registration eligibility.

#### Additional Considerations and Timeline

The entire process typically spans 4–8 weeks, assuming prompt document handling. Costs include notary fees (€1,000–€2,000), court registration (€200–€400), translations (€500+), and bank setup (variable). Virtual offices reduce overhead, starting at €100/month.

For Japanese firms, aligning fiscal years and purposes facilitates group consolidation under IFRS or J-GAAP. Post-incorporation, address trade register updates, social security, and employment law compliance.

#### Conclusion: Navigating Complexity with Expertise

Incorporating a GmbH in Germany unlocks access to the EU single market, skilled talent, and innovation hubs like Berlin. However, nuances—such as apostille requirements or capital optimization—can complicate execution without specialist support.
