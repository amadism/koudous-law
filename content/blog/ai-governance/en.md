As a German attorney specializing, amongst others, in cross-border data protection and compliance, I frequently bridge the gap between European regulatory frameworks and Asian business practices. In August 2025, I had the privilege of speaking at a hybrid seminar in Tokyo titled "Data Security and AI Governance: Latest Trends in AI and GDPR," moderated by my esteemed colleague Hiroto Ebata (ex Microsoft Japan, ex Coca Cola Japan). Organized by RegalCore Co., Ltd., where I also serve as Board Member, the event drew over 50 participants—executives, legal professionals, and DX leaders—both in-person at GIRAC Ginza and online. The essence: With AI's rapid evolution expanding business opportunities, it simultaneously amplifies legal and ethical risks, from data privacy breaches to discrimination and copyright infringements. This gathering provided a platform for Japanese and European experts to dissect these challenges and outline practical safeguards.

The seminar's timing was prescient, coinciding with mounting global scrutiny of AI deployment. Drawing from discussions with speakers Keiko Watanabe of BICP Data and RegalCore's CEO Mr Tanoue, alongside my own insights on the EU AI Act, the event underscored a pivotal shift: AI is no longer a technological novelty but a governance imperative. Japanese firms, in particular, stand at a crossroads, where proactive measures can transform regulatory compliance into a competitive edge.

#### Unveiling AI Risks: From Hallucinations to Shareholder Scrutiny

One of the seminar's most compelling revelations was the parallel between the GDPR's transformative impact on Japanese data protection—enforcing fines up to €20 million or 4% of global annual turnover—and the emerging wave of AI-specific regulations. Just as GDPR reshaped corporate hygiene a decade ago, AI governance now permeates boardroom agendas, including shareholder proposals at annual general meetings. In the U.S., 2025 saw 20 such proposals at major firms like Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, and Netflix, with 10 focused on generative AI oversight—several narrowly passing. Japanese enterprises are following suit, with internal study groups proliferating; BICP Data, for instance, supports these initiatives to foster enterprise-wide awareness.

Ms Watanabe, drawing from her extensive experience in internet and data sectors, emphasized that enterprises ignoring AI integration risk obsolescence. "AI governance serves as a preventive measure—a staff to avert falls—managing and mitigating risks that cannot be eliminated entirely," she noted. Yet, she highlighted its offensive potential: Robust frameworks build societal and customer trust, enabling bolder innovation. Risk profiles escalate with sophistication: Conventional AI poses baseline concerns like data bias; generative AI introduces hallucinations (e.g., inaccuracies in automated responses); and AI agents—autonomous systems on the horizon—amplify uncertainties around accountability and unintended actions.

Mr Tanoue complemented this with a demonstration of RegalCore's "Cyber Insight Portal," a visualization tool that standardizes cyber risks across organizations. By translating complex threats into common language, it cultivates internal momentum, ensuring alignment from C-suite to operational teams. In an era of escalating cyber incidents, such tools democratize security intelligence, much like dashboards in financial reporting.

#### The EU AI Act: A Risk-Based Blueprint with Phased Implications

From my perspective as an attorney practising in this realm, the EU AI Act—formally adopted in May 2024 and entering phased application from August 2025—represents the most comprehensive AI regulatory regime worldwide. Unlike the GDPR's focus on data flows, the Act adopts a tiered, risk-based approach to AI systems:

- **Prohibited Practices:** Immediate bans on unacceptable risks, such as social scoring or manipulative subliminal techniques, effective February 2025.
- **High-Risk Systems:** Stringent obligations for sectors like biometrics, critical infrastructure, and hiring tools—including conformity assessments, transparency reporting, and human oversight—phased in by August 2026.
- **General-Purpose AI:** Requirements for transparency and risk management in models like large language models, with stricter rules for "systemic risk" providers (e.g., those exceeding computational thresholds) from August 2025.
- **Enforcement:** Fines mirroring GDPR levels, up to €35 million or 7% of global turnover, administered by national authorities with EU-wide coordination.

For Japanese multinationals, the Act's extraterritorial reach—applying to any AI impacting EU markets or users—demands immediate inventorying of deployments. Early cases illustrate the stakes: An airline's AI Q\&A chatbot hallucinated flight details, sparking liability claims; recruitment tools faced discrimination suits under equal opportunity laws; and GDPR violations via unconsented AI training data have drawn multimillion-euro penalties. Non-compliance could force market withdrawal or relocation, echoing GDPR's early enforcement waves.

The Act's horizon scanning—requiring impact assessments for high-risk uses—mirrors Japanese kaizen principles, encouraging iterative improvements. Yet, its rigidity contrasts with Japan's more flexible stance, urging firms to harmonize internal policies for seamless EU operations.

#### Japan's Unique Lens on AI: Depth of Awareness as a Strategic Asset

What struck me most during the Tokyo discussions—and resonates with recent data—is Japan's nuanced perception of AI. A study released in October 2025 reveals Japan leading globally in in-depth AI awareness: 53% of respondents report substantial exposure to the topic, surpassing France (52%) and Germany (51%), against a global median of 34%. Overall familiarity is also high at 89%, second only to Australia (97%), highlighting a sophisticated public discourse that outpaces emerging markets like India (45%).

This depth fosters a balanced view: AI as both opportunity and imperative for caution. Japanese businesses, per Ms Watanabe's observations, view governance not as a burden but as "trust infrastructure," aligning with cultural emphases on harmony (wa) and collective responsibility. Unlike Europe's precautionary principle, Japan's approach leans pragmatic—evident in government guidelines promoting ethical AI without prohibitive bans. This positions Japan advantageously: Firms like SoftBank and Toyota integrate AI ethically from inception, mitigating risks while accelerating adoption in robotics and manufacturing.

The survey's implications are clear for global players: Japan's high awareness correlates with proactive board-level discussions, reducing litigation exposure. As shareholder activism rises—mirroring U.S. trends—Japanese companies initiating AI audits now will lead, not react.

### Exchange and Forward Momentum

The seminar concluded with a networking reception, where participants exchanged strategies for embedding AI governance into corporate DNA. Mr Tanoue's portal demo sparked lively debates on visualization's role in risk communication, while Ms Watanabe and I fielded queries on cross-jurisdictional compliance.

Reflecting two months later, the event crystallized a truth: In 2025, AI governance is no longer optional. For Japanese firms eyeing European expansion, the EU AI Act demands preparation akin to GDPR's rollout—starting with audits, training, and vendor assessments. Yet, Japan's innate depth in AI literacy offers a head start, turning potential pitfalls into pathways for innovation.

As we navigate this landscape, collaboration between Japanese ingenuity and European rigor will define leaders.
