## Legal basis

Koudous Law processes data based on the GDPR. The main reasons are:

- **Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR):** You have agreed that we may use your data for a specific purpose.
- **Contracts (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR):** We need the data to fulfill a contract with you or to respond to your inquiry before entering into a contract.
- **Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR):** We use data for our business interests, as long as your rights do not outweigh them.

In addition to the GDPR, German laws such as the Federal Data Protection Act (BDSG) also apply. It regulates, for example, your right to information or deletion. State data protection laws may also apply. If a specific legal basis applies, we will inform you here.

## Disclosure of data

Sometimes Koudous Law shares your data with others, such as IT service providers or companies that embed content on our website. We comply with laws and enter into contracts to protect your data.

### Within our group:

Koudous Law may share data with other companies in our group, for example for administrative purposes, based on our interests, for contracts, or with your consent.

### Within our organization:

Koudous Law may share data internally, for the same reasons - administration, contracts, or with your consent or legal permission.

## International data transfer

If Koudous Law processes or shares data outside the EU or the European Economic Area (EEA), we only do so in compliance with the law. This can be secured by:

- An EU "adequacy decision" (Art. 45 GDPR), which recognizes the data protection level of a country.
- Standard contractual clauses (Art. 46(2)(c) GDPR) or your express consent (Art. 49(1) GDPR).

Example: In the EU-US Data Privacy Framework (DPF), some US companies are certified as secure (see [www.dataprivacyframework.gov/](http://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/)). We will inform you if we use such providers. More information is available on the EU Commission website (ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection).

## Deletion of data

Koudous Law deletes your data as soon as we no longer need it, you withdraw your consent, or the legal basis ceases to exist - unless we are required to retain it for legal reasons (e.g. tax law). In such cases, we will block the data and only use it for that purpose.

## Your rights

Under the GDPR (Articles 15-21), you have rights regarding your data:

- **Objection:** You can object to processing based on our interests or used for advertising.
- **Withdrawal:** You can withdraw your consent at any time.
- **Information:** You can ask if we process your data and request a copy.
- **Correction:** You can have incorrect data corrected.
- **Deletion or restriction:** You can request deletion or restricted use.
- **Data portability:** You can receive your data in a usable format or have it transferred to someone else.
- **Complaint:** You can complain to a data protection authority, for example where you live or work.

## Cookies

- We ask for your consent, except for essential cookies (e.g. for security or basic functions).

### Types of cookies:
