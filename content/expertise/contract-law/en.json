    "heading": "How I Help",
    "description": "I start by understanding your business relationships—your deals, your partners, your obligations—so every contract I draft or review fits like a glove. Need new agreements? I craft contracts—vendor deals, service pacts, licensing arrangements—that lock in favorable terms, define clear obligations, and shield you from liability. Whether it's a straightforward NDA or a complex multi-party agreement, I build in the protections you need.",
    "details": "Got an existing contract that's giving you trouble? I'll review it with a fine-tooth comb, spotting the gaps, the gotchas, and the clauses that could bite you later—then I'll tell you exactly how to fix them or renegotiate better terms."

    "details": "I don't just react to problems. For businesses that need speed and consistency, I create contract templates—NDAs, terms of service, employment agreements—that you can deploy again and again, knowing they're bulletproof. I've handled contracts across industries and borders, so I know how to navigate the quirks of German law, EU regulations, and international trade rules."

  "whyMe": {
    "heading": "Why Me",
    "description": "I've spent years mastering contract law for businesses of every size—startups closing their first deals, growing companies scaling up partnerships, enterprises managing complex supplier networks. I've drafted agreements that saved clients from seven-figure liabilities, renegotiated terms that turned money-losing deals into profit centers, and resolved disputes that could have destroyed valuable relationships. My strength is precision—I know where contracts break: the vague clause that sparks litigation, the missing termination right that traps you in a bad deal, the liability cap that's too high.",
    "details": "I don't just write contracts; I think through the scenarios—what happens if they breach, if you need to exit, if the market shifts—and I build those protections in from day one. Clients stick with me because I don't waste time. I've seen too many lawyers who overcomplicate things or miss the business context—I cut to the chase: 'Here's the risk, here's the fix, done.' I've rescued companies from contract disasters and set up frameworks that scale. You're hiring someone who's been in the trenches, knows the game, and keeps your deals solid—no surprises, just contracts that work."
