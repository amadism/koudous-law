      "heading": "Why Me",
      "description": "I've been entrenched in esports law for years, shaping the legal landscape with real-world wins—being the former Head of Legal at G2 Esports—securing their roster and revenue, and co-authoring the Nomos legal commentary that defined the rules for Germany and the EU. I've crushed IP theft cases that saved team brands from knockoffs, settled sponsor disputes that kept the cash flowing, and built contracts that sidestepped the quirks of German esports regulations like a pro.",
      "strength": "My edge comes from being in the thick of it—I spot the weak spots others miss: the sloppy IP clause that sparks a court case, the vague sponsor term that bleeds euros, the compliance oversight that triggers a data protection audit. I've handled streamers tangled in sponsor messes, teams wrestling with player contract chaos, and platforms juggling EU data and broadcasting rules—mastering all as well as esports-specific regulations inside out.",
      "clientTrust": "What sets me apart is that I don't choke under pressure. Clients—teams, streamers, orgs—have ditched lawyers who drag deadlines or pad bills with fluff; I cut straight to it: 'Here's your exposure, here's the play, let's execute.' Remember the famous Perkz deal that shook the entire League of Legends community? That was on my watch—proof that I operate where the stakes are real.",
      "trackRecord": "You're bringing on someone who's played the esports legal game at the highest level, racked up the wins, and keeps your digital hustle ahead of the pack—no noise, just results that dominate."
