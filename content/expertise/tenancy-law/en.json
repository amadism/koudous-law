    "description": "I dive into your real estate situation—what you rent, what you offer, where your risks lie—so I can provide targeted legal support. Need contracts?

  "whyMe": {
    "heading": "Why Me",
    "description": "I've managed tenant disputes and contracts across industries for years—helping businesses secure favorable lease terms, landlords protect their properties, and both sides resolve conflicts without destroying valuable relationships. I've negotiated leases that saved clients thousands annually, resolved disputes that preserved key business locations, and structured agreements that scaled with growing companies. My edge is practical experience—I've seen what breaks real estate relationships: the vague maintenance clause that becomes a money pit, the inflexible lease that traps a struggling business, the ignored notice requirement that invalidates termination.",
    "details": "What sets me apart is that I don't just follow the legal playbook—I write new strategies tailored to your situation. Clients stick with me because I deliver results, not just documents. I've heard complaints about lawyers who overcomplicate simple leases or miss negotiation opportunities—I don't. I'll tell you: 'Here's your leverage, here's the ask, let's close this.' I've saved clients by catching problematic terms early or structuring exits that avoided lengthy disputes. You're hiring someone who's been in the real estate trenches, facing tough landlords and problematic tenants, and delivered wins that stick—no complications, just solutions that work."
