  "intro": "Media law is the legal amplifier for your content—whether broadcasting, publishing, or digital platforms. I step in to protect your creative output, negotiate deals that maximize revenue, and navigate regulations that keep your media operations compliant and competitive. My approach is tuned to your goals: understand what you produce, identify the risks, and build legal frameworks that let your brand shine without legal static drowning you out. From content creators landing their first brand partnerships to major publishers managing cross-border licensing, I deliver solutions that turn your media presence into a powerhouse.",

    "description": "I start by tuning into your setup—what you produce, who consumes it, where it goes—so I can craft solutions tailored to your media model. Need contracts? I draft licensing agreements, talent deals, and sponsorship pacts that lock in favorable terms: royalty structures that protect your revenue, usage rights that prevent exploitation, exclusivity clauses that reward your brand. I've created agreements that secured six-figure sponsorships and protected content from unauthorized use.",
    "details": "Disputes making noise? I step in—whether it's a German publisher dodging royalties, a talent breach threatening your production schedule, or a copyright infringer stealing your content. I'll negotiate resolutions that preserve relationships or litigate with strategies rooted in German and EU media law to protect your bottom line."
