  "title": "Distribution Law: Optimize Your Supply Chain",
  "intro": "Distribution law in Germany and the EU is the legal fuel for your supply chain—whether you're moving products across borders, negotiating with distributors, or structuring your sales network, I make sure your agreements protect your interests and keep goods flowing. From drafting distribution contracts that lock in your margins to resolving disputes with partners who aren't holding up their end, I deliver sharp, practical solutions that keep your business competitive. My approach is direct: understand your distribution model, identify the risks, and build legal frameworks that maximize efficiency while minimizing exposure. Whether you're a startup launching your first distributor network or a multinational managing complex multi-tier channels across the EU, I provide the legal backbone that turns supply chain challenges into strategic advantages.",

    "description": "I start by mapping your chain—what you move, who you work with, where it goes—so I can craft solutions that fit your specific distribution model. Need contracts? I draft and negotiate distribution agreements with terms that work for you: pricing structures that protect margins, exclusivity clauses that reward performance, termination rights that let you pivot when things go south. I've created agreements that prevented distributors from jumping ship and secured favorable terms that boosted client revenue streams.",
    "details": "Dispute brewing? I jump in—whether it's a German partner dodging payments, an EU distributor breaching exclusivity, or a cross-border shipment stuck in customs red tape. I'll negotiate fast resolutions or take it to court with strategies rooted in German HGB and EU commercial law, protecting your supply chain from disruption."

    "heading": "Why Me",
    "description": "I've spent years fueling German and EU supply chains through distribution law—helping manufacturers scale their networks, retailers secure reliable suppliers, and logistics companies navigate complex partner agreements. I've closed deals that opened new markets, resolved disputes that saved key partnerships, and restructured distribution models that turned losses into profits. My strength is foresight—I catch the hooks others miss: the payment term that bleeds cash, the termination clause that traps you with underperformers, the competition law violation that triggers EU fines.",
    "details": "I've worked across sectors—consumer goods with their retail complexities, tech hardware with cross-border logistics, food and beverage with regulatory hurdles—so I know the game, from German supply chain due diligence to EU customs regulations. Clients stick with me because I don't dawdle. I've heard complaints about lawyers who delay deals or miss business realities—I cut through: 'Here's the risk, here's the fix, let's move.' I've saved companies by spotting deal-breakers early or negotiating terms that secured profitable partnerships. My track record is strong: I turned a startup's first deal into a steady stream, kept an enterprise compliant across the EU, and resolved a distributor dispute that could've cost millions. You're hiring someone who's been in the supply chain trenches and delivers wins that scale."
